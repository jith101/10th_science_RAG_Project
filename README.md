# 10th_science_textbook_RAG_Project
I have created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application for the 10th-grade NCERT science textbook. It can remember up to 6 previous conversations, allowing users to continue discussions seamlessly. The history buffer size can be adjusted by setting the r variable to any desired number.

The user interface is built using Gradio, providing a simple and user-friendly experience for interacting with the chatbot.

One limitation of the application is that the textbook file is quite large—around 150 MB—so it takes some time to load and embed the PDF file. 

Full book is available in https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?jesc1=0-16
